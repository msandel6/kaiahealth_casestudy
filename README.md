### Note! The API is returning a 404, so I have not been able to manually test this and make sure it works as expected. I will continue to try periodically and may push future commits if any fixes are needed.
The code is currently in a PR from a `wip` branch to make it more clear that it's not "final". Once I've been able to manually verify, I'll merge it to `main` and update this comment.
